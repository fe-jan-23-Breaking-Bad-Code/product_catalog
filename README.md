## Features
- **Phone Page**: Clicking on the "Phones" option in the navigation menu takes users to a dedicated phone page. Here, users can sort phones by newest arrivals, view a specific number of items per page, search by name, and navigate through pagination.
- **Details Page**: Clicking on a phone directs users to the details page, where they can customize specifications such as RAM and see the price change accordingly. Users can also modify the color, add items to the cart, or save them as favorites.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can access the shopping cart, which displays all selected phones and provides a total amount for the purchase.
- **Favorites**: Users can access their favorites and view the phones they have saved. They can also remove items from the favorites list.
- **User Authentication**: To make a purchase, users must register through Google. Additionally, a verification code is sent to the user's phone to verify their identity.
